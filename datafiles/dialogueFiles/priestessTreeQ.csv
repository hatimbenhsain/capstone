The tree.,a,,,,,
Can you tell me more about this glowing fruit tree?,,,,,hero,thinking
"You said there's only one of its kind, right? I'm surprised the invaders didn't attack it.",,,,,hero,confused
"It's because they couldn't find it, even if they were looking for it.",,,,,priestess,serene
Uh... Wouldn't a glowing tree be pretty obvious?,,,,,hero,suspicious
"Not if we put a spell on it, no.",,,,,priestess,serene
Oooh. How does it work?,,,,,hero,happy
The tree only shows itself in its true form to those who have proven their devotion to the Goddess.,,,,,priestess,serene
"Otherwise, it appears merely as another tree.",,,,,priestess,pensive
I see. So... did the other trees always look like this?,,,,,hero,thinking
"No. Those, the humans burned.",,,,,priestess,neutral
But the spell works so that the tree's appearance blends with its surroundings. ,,,,,priestess,neutral
"Which means that before, it looked like a normal forest tree.",,,,,priestess,neutral
Thankfully it's still mostly intact.,,,,,priestess,pensive
"It doesn't burn as easily as any other tree, and the humans couldn't have known better.",,,,,priestess,neutral
Okay... Which one is it then?,,,,,hero,thinking
Well I am... not sure.,,,FadeOutMusic,3000,priestess,neutral
"I wasn't tasked with collecting the fruit, so I never had to prove myself to the tree.",,,,,priestess,neutral
But aren't you devoted to your goddess?,,,Shake,50,hero,thinking
Of course I am!,,,,,priestess,angry
It's... more complicated than that.,,,,,priestess,neutral
...Care to elaborate?,,,,,hero,shocked
No. My faith is not for you to question.,,,,,priestess,angry
"I know, I know! I... didn't mean to be rude.",,,,,hero,shocked
...,,,,,priestess,pensive
(This must be a touchy subject for her... Maybe I can find information on the tree on my own?),,,ChangeState,20,hero,confused

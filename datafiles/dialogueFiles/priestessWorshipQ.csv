Worshipping the Goddess.,a,,,,,
You talked about general ways to worship the goddess... How does it work?,,,,,hero,thinking
"It's pretty standard. We leave offerings, make sacrifices, tell secrets...",,,,,priestess,neutral
Secrets?,,,,,hero,thinking
"Yes. Our goddess draws her power from what is kept away from the public eye, so...",,,,,priestess,neutral
"...by telling her what we haven't told anyone else, we prove our devotion to her, and our trust that she will keep it safe.",,,,,priestess,neutral
Oh! That's interesting.,,,,,hero,shocked
What kind of things have you told her?,,,,,hero,thinking
"It wouldn't be a secret if I were to tell you, would it?",,,,,priestess,pensive
"Oh, yeah, you're right...",,,,,hero,confused
What about the sacrifices?,,,,,hero,thinking
My mom told me that people used to slaughter animals for their gods... Is it something similar?,,,,,hero,neutral
"Oh, no, nothing of the sort.",,,,,priestess,pensive
Sacrifices - like secrets - are things which you hold dear to you.,,,,,priestess,neutral
"For example... a family ring, or a childhood toy.",,,,,priestess,pensive
"It doesn't have to be precious, as long as it holds an important personal value.",,,,,priestess,neutral
Why... would you give that up?,,,,,hero,suspicious
"Well, we don't do that everyday, of course. ",,,,,priestess,pensive
"But when we do it, it's a way to show that none of our attachments matter as much as our worship.",,,,,,
"So it's not an act to be done lightly. We reserve it for big occasions, like joining the priesthood, or if we need divine intervention.",,,,,priestess,neutral
And then you... burn the object?,,,,,hero,confused
"That can be done, yes, but it is more conventional to bury it in the ground, especially in sacred locations.",,,,,priestess,neutral
But couldn't you just dig it back up?,,,,,hero,thinking
"If you really mean the sacrifice, then no, the Earth will swallow it forever.",,,,,priestess,neutral
..! That's... pretty radical.,,,,,hero,shocked
"Yes, it's meant to be.",,,,,priestess,neutral

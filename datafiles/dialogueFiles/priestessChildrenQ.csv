The children.,a,,,,,
You... mentioned children earlier.,,2,,,hero,confused
I did.,,,SwitchBgm,audio_despairBgm,priestess,neutral
"As I mentioned earlier, our goddess is also the goddess of the outcasts.",,,,,priestess,neutral
"It was therefore our duty to take in any... runaway, abandoned, or orphaned child who wandered here.",,,,,priestess,pensive
"The same happened to you, right?",,,,,hero,thinking
Yes.,,,,,priestess,pensive
Did you see...,,,,,priestess,pensive
Did you see the bird-shaped statues? Near the forest?,,,,,priestess,neutral
"The bird statues? I think, yeah?",,,,,hero,thinking
They smelled kinda weird.,,,,,hero,cringe
Those weren't only for decorative purposes.,,,,,priestess,pensive
"Every morning, before breakfast, we used to put food inside of them, as an offering to the Goddess.",,,,,priestess,neutral
Did... she eat it?,,,,,hero,thinking
Ha. Of course not.,,,,,priestess,serene
The food was for those who wander in the forest.,,,,,priestess,happy
A lot of wanderers don't want to be bothered by anyone - not even other outcasts like ourselves.,,,,,priestess,neutral
But a lot of them still needed help. They just couldn't come forward.,,,,,priestess,pensive
"So we left food for them, with the hope that when - if - they were ready, they would join us for a meal.",,,,,priestess,pensive
Oh... That makes sense.,,,,,hero,thinking
What does this have to do with the children though?,,,,,hero,thinking
The children loved the food we made for the wanderers.,,,,,priestess,neutral
"Once they caught onto it, they started sneaking right after we put it to steal a bit.",,,,,priestess,pensive
Right under our nose. And we kept wondering why they started eating so little at breakfast. Haha..,,,,,priestess,serene
We only realized once one of the smaller ones got hurt trying to climb a statue.,,,,,priestess,neutral
"She broke her arm. But as soon as she recovered, she started stealing food again.",,,,,priestess,thinking
"No matter how much we scolded them, they kept doing it.",,,,,priestess,thinking
Even when we tried to make their breakfast food better. I think they just enjoyed the thrill.,,,,,priestess,neutral
"And besides them getting hurt, it was a problem since they were taking food away from the wanderers.",,,,,priestess,neutral
That's when we came up with the chick statues.,,,,,priestess,serene
Oh! I was wondering why some statues were smaller than others.,,,,,hero,shocked
"Yes. We made them specifically for the kids, and we hid candy in them...",,,,,priestess,happy
...Along with the normal offerings every morning.,,,,,priestess,happy
"The children stopped getting hurt, and the wanderers had their food back. It worked well.",,,,,priestess,serene
That's pretty smart.,,,,,hero,happy
....,,,,,priestess,pensive
It is... my greatest regret that I wasn't able to defend the children.,,,,,priestess,thinking
Did you...,,,,,hero,sad
"I didn't even see them. When the humans came, I was one of the first to go.",,,FadeOutMusic,3000,priestess,sad
....,,,,,priestess,sad
Where were you exactly? When it happened?,,,,,hero,sad
....,,,,,priestess,shocked
"I'm sorry, I didn't wanna make you relive it.",,,FadeInMusic,3000,hero,shocked
"It's... No, it's fine. I'll tell you how it happened.",,,ChangeState,19,priestess,sad

Do you wanna -,,,,,hero,sad
It was in the morning. ,,,,,priestess,neutral
I was in the kitchen. This was after we put the food in the statues.,,,,,priestess,neutral
We were almost done preparing breakfast.,,,,,priestess,neutral
"By then, I'm sure the children already had time to take the candy, so we were about to serve.",,,,,priestess,neutral
That's when I heard them marching.,,,,,priestess,neutral
....,,,,,priestess,pensive
I went out of the gate to see what was happening.,,,,,priestess,pensive
I'd never seen... that many humans at once.,,,,,priestess,pensive
"I'd heard before from other priests about the citizens' shifting thoughts about our gods, but...",,,,,priestess,pensive
I honestly didn't know how much hate humanity was capable of.,,,,,priestess,thinking
I...,,,,,hero,pensive
I didn't know either.,,,,,hero,sad
....,,,,,priestess,thinking
"I couldn't do anything. As soon as they saw me, they started running. I froze.",,,,,priestess,neutral
And they pierced me with their lances.,,,,,priestess,neutral
"But I... You see, our bodies are much more resilient than yours.",,,,,priestess,pensive
"Of course, I died anyway.",,,,,priestess,neutral
But it took hours. And all I could do was lie there and hear my people's screams. One by one.,,,,,priestess,sad
So you didn't see the children die?,,,,,hero,thinking
What?,,,,,priestess,shocked
How do you know everyone died if you didn't see them?,,,,,hero,thinking
You... You mean to say...,,,,,priestess,shocked
You think those men would've spared anyone just because they're... children?,,,,,priestess,angry
"Even if they had a shred of mercy in them, they saw us as monsters. They wanted to eradicate us.",,,,,priestess,angry
They didn't even give me a chance to talk. They just stabbed me and left me to die.,,,,,priestess,angry
"....True. And I'm sorry I'm upsetting you, but how do you know for sure that no one escaped?",,,,,hero,pensive
None of us would have.,,,,,priestess,angry
What?,,,,,hero,shocked
I was... I am devoted to my goddess. I would gladly give my life for her sake again.,,,,,priestess,pensive
And I know every other priest felt the same way.,,,,,priestess,neutral
But -,,,,,hero,sad
"It's true, the children didn't necessarily share our devotion.",,,,,priestess,pensive
But the sad reality is that... ,,,,,priestess,neutral
"Even if they did escape, they couldn't have survived in the woods on their own.",,,,,priestess,neutral
Huh...,,,,,hero,sad
So please. Just drop it.,,,,,priestess,neutral
...,,,,,hero,suspicious
I know this it's difficult to talk about but -,,,,,hero,suspicious
No.,,,,,priestess,neutral
...Alright.,,,SwitchBgm,audio_investigationBgm,hero,suspicious

The statue pieces.,a,,,,noone,
So the statue fragment I found is meant to look that way?,,,,,hero,thinking
Yes. It's one of the few things that was broken before the humans came.,,,,,priestess,neutral
Huh.,,,,,hero,thinking
"When you came across it, did you feel... a pull?",,,,,priestess,neutral
I did actually! How did you know?,,,,,hero,happy
"Well, the statue that the pieces form is very important. You see...",,,,,priestess,pensive
It allows us to directly communicate with the goddess.,,,,,priestess,neutral
Oh!,,,,,hero,shocked
"Once a year, we all gather to reunite the pieces on a special stand, at the center of the temple.",,,,,priestess,pensive
"Then, if the right conditions are met, the Goddess comes down.",,,,,priestess,serene
She possesses the statue and answers our most pressing questions.,,,,,priestess,serene
Cool! What are the conditions?,,,,,hero,happy
"Well, one is that the questions have to be pressing enough...",,,,,priestess,neutral
...for the Goddess to trouble herself with coming down here.,,,,,priestess,neutral
And the others?,,,,,hero,thinking
We're... not entirely sure.,,,,,priestess,pensive
"But we trust that if the Goddess doesn't come, it must be for reasons beyond our comprehension.",,,,,priestess,neutral
"I see, I see. So...",,,,,hero,thinking
What is she... like? When she does come? How does it happen?,,,,,hero,thinking
I... unfortunately haven't witnessed a possession.,,,,,priestess,neutral
You haven't?,,,,,hero,suspicious
No.,,,,,priestess,neutral
When.. was the last time she came down here?,,,,,hero,confused
We're not entirely sure of that either.,,,,,priestess,neutral
Oh.,,,,,hero,confused
...,,,,,priestess,pensive
Well I'm sure she must be busy...,,,,,hero,happy
"With some sort of, like, godly war or something, for her to be absent for so long!",,,,,,
I don't know of gods warring with each other.,,,,,priestess,neutral
"It's... like you said, there's a lot we don't know.",,,,,hero,cringe
"Anyway... the fragments are kept apart so that they're harder to find, I imagine?",,,,,hero,thinking
Yes. Each fragment - all five of them - usually stay with a different priest tasked to preserve it.,,,,,priestess,neutral
It's one of the measures we've taken to make sure they never fall in the invader's hands.,,,,,priestess,neutral
They also won't bother destroying a statue if it's already broken.,,,,,priestess,neutral
Ah... I guess your precautions paid off.,,,,,hero,pensive
They did.,,,,,priestess,neutral
I'll try to find the other pieces! Maybe I'll be able to communicate with the Goddess!,,,ChangeState,33,hero,excited
Hah. I doubt it.,,,,,priestess,serene
